## 🌌 Why VerseSync?

Fictional universes form the backbone of modern entertainment—spanning literature, film, television, comics, and games. As these narrative worlds grow increasingly complex, keeping timelines, character histories, and magical laws consistent becomes challenging.

> ✨ *“Inconsistencies break immersion. Consistency builds legends.”*  

VerseSync leverages **Natural Language Processing** and **Knowledge Graphs** to systematically analyze texts, detect contradictions, and preserve narrative integrity.
